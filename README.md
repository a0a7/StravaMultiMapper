- Filter activities by date, sport type, commute status and visibility

- Many separate display modes incorporating different metrics (Frequency Heatmap, Elevation, Time of Year, Solid Color)

- Tabular list of activities with support for displaying & sorting by many metrics (Name, Distance, Calories, Avg. Speed, Avg. Power, Avg. Heartrate, Date) & filtering by keyword

### ❖ Map

- Customizable basemap appearance (Light, Dark, Satellite, Landscape, Topographic, Winter, or none)

- Map export to PNG, JPG, PDF and SVG with detailed control over export dimensions and resolution.

- Distance measurements via measurement control

- Automatic zoom-to-fit activities added to map

### ❖ Comforts

- Fully-featured light/dark mode with persistence via browser stores & automatic preference detection + manual control

- Resizable & collapsible settings sidebar (desktop) or drawer (mobile) with layout persistence through browser stores

### ❖ Technical

- Session persistence via Auth.js

- Parallel fetching of activities
